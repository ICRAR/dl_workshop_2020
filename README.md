Topics not final, up for discussion

what is softmax, what is the appropriate loss? 


*  Introductory talk on stochastic gradient descent as optimization ?
*  Stochastic Gradient Descent as an alternative to EM algorithm. GMM Example, make GMM very large/high dimensional, to see where EM breaks ?
*  Introductory talk on MLPs? Plus workthrough example?  MNIST is good here, also a simple isochrone? 
*  Deep Learning with uncertainty: MLP Gaussian Mixture Models example? 
*  Introductory talk on ConvNets (1D/2D)
*  Galaxy ZOO revisited (causal structure) (Conv2D and MLP)
*  Introductory talk on LSTMs/time series? - Compare with Convs?
*  Add 1D convolution/LSTM classification, something from astronomy? NEED DATASET  
*  Tips and tricks on training neural networks (overfit in training, monitor statistics, train/test split, avoid data leakage, overfit a single datum).
Talk about feature balancing. https://blog.slavv.com/37-reasons-why-your-neural-network-is-not-working-4020854bd607 
*  Tips and tricks on designing a software pipeline (modularize everything, print proper statistics, automate things when/wherever possible). Kevin? ML at Chevron is EXCELLENT example!!! 
*  Plasticc classification? Not sure
